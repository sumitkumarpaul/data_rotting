This uses your dummy personal data issued by the data-issuer to measure the performance of the system:

You need to provide the above-mentioned information to a trusted enclave which will process
these information and computes the inner product of all the provided parameters. We will use enclave(2) from the LibEnc
for this purpose. Apart from this trusted enclave(2), none(including us) will be able to view
your data. Even the trusted enclave will not be able to use the provided data after the expiry
time specified by you. You can know about the details about enclave(2), directly from LibEnc.  

Following is the description of enclave(2), fetched from LibEnc:

This enclave accesses all the data present within the personal information file. This is for performance measurement
